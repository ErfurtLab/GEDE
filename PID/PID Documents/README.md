This folder covers documents that are of relevance to the EOSC discussions about PID Policies. We understand that one of the first priorities in EOSC is to come to agreed recommendations on how to set up a PID system for all European researchers respecting the different use cases from data intensive labs up to data publications and defining PIDs for different FAIR Digital Object Types such as data, metadata, assertions, persons, instruments, etc. In case that someone would like another document being uploaded as well, please, send it to Suzi (zsuzsanna.szeredi@gmail.com).
