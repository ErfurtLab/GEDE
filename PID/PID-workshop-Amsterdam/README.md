At 4/5.11.2019 GEDE organised a workshop on building a "European PID Service" and the requirements for such a service. Some experts from research infrastructure and some service providers have been invited to this meeting. The results will be discussed openly with the GEDE members. The agreement was 
- to write an updated requirements paper and 
- to come up with a balanced organisational setup.

This folder contains the agenda, all slides, and when ready the two papers to be produced.
