In these folders we will list all papers about Digital Objects which emerged in the realm of RDA-GEDE DO, C2CAMP, RDA and DONA and which were finished. We separate two categories: a) those explaining aspects of DO, b) those that relate DO and FAIR principles.

If colleagues wrote papers that fall in this category, then please send them to us so that we can include them.
