The GEDE group has submitted a proposal for a COST Action. We formed an editing team to prepare the second proposal version to 
be submitted in September 2019. The members are Koenraad de Smedt, Dimitris Koureas, Rūta Petrauskaitė, Leif Laaksonen, Peter Wittenburg.
Currently, a draft version is being finished and will be published here until mid-Aufgust.
One of the urgent questions to be addressed is to improve the Country balance across Europe - some countries are not yet involved with 
experts. Please send an email to Zsuzsanna or Peter (zsuzsanna.szeredi@gmail.com; peter.wittenburg@mpcdf.mpg.de) to participate.
