# Digital Objects
This folder covers all activities of the RDA GEDE Digital Object Topic Group which covers about 150 experts from about 50 reesearch infrastructures. It focuses on mainly organising work between Europeans, but its list also contain colleagues from other reagions. GEDE DO worked closely together with a global initiative called C2CAMP which is a group of people that were and are active in the RDA Data Fabric group that want to build components of the emerging Digital Object Infrastructure. Due to the large overlap between the GEDE-DO and C2CAMP initiatives we merged the two lists now in the transition to FAIR Digital Objects. There is also much overlap with the Data Fabric group and a few other groups in RDA.

This folder contains currently the following sub-folders:
- Foundational-Documents - Current state: Assertions on DO, Roadmap for DO Work, some Term Definitions
- DO-Webinars - all documents about webinars organised by GEDE DO & C2CAMP
- DO-Workshops - all documents about workshops organised by GEDE DO & C2CAMP
- DO-Surveys - all information about surveys beeing carried out by GEDE DO & C2CAMP
- Papers(finished) - all papers that are beeing written in the realm of GEDE DO & C2CAMP
- Papers(in-work) - an indication of papers that are being thought of
- Projects - all information about projects being excuted or planned in the realm of GEDE DO & C2CAMP
- Relations - GEDE DO has some related activities with industry, with IoT-Forum, etc. which will be documented

This work on Digital Objects is now being continued under the heading of FAIR Digital Objects which basically brings together DOs and the FAIR principles and makes use of Semantic Web concepts to make DOs fully FAIR compliant. Please, see under FAIR Digital Objects in this GEDE Github site.

We will maintain the RDA GEDE DO Group as envelop for the work on FAIR Digital Objects. To simplify the administration we merged the two email lists and activities of C2CAMP and GED DO. The former co-chairs of GEDE DO (Dimitris Koureas, Koenraad de Smedt, Peter Wittenburg with the help of Zsuzsanna Szeredi) are now fully involved in the coordination of the FAIR DO work. Also the former co-chairs of C2CAMP (Larry Lannom, Peter Wittenburg) are fully involved in the FAIR DO work.

We welcome discussion contributions to all content of this GEDE DO Group and suggestions for further actions.
