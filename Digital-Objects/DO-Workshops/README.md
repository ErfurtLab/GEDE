This folder will contain all materials releevant for the workshops (face-22-face, web) organised by the RDA GEDE DO group. 
Currently, we have had 3 workshops: 
- December 2018 in Brussels
- April 2019 in Philadelphia (RDA Plenary)
- Web Workshop at 22 May 2019

We expect more to come. We welcome comments to all contents presented and all would accept suggestions for new workshops - be it face-2-face or virtual workshops.
