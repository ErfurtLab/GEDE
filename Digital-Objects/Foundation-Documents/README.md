This folder includes a few foundational GEDE DO documents (assertions, roadmap, terms). These documents weree written while the concet of FAIR Digital Objects, i.e. Digital Objects that satisfy the FAIR principles, was dveloped and adopted by the DO community. Future versions of these documents will be maintained under the folder FAIR Digital Objects and take account of the necessary extensions.
