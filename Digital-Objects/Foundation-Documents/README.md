This folder includes a few foundational GEDE DO documents (assertions, roadmap, terms).
We would like to invite everyone to give comments and/or suggest other documents which could be basic for GEDE DO. 
You can also use the Google Doc versions to enter your comments, however, we suggest to make a note here that you suggeest changes.
