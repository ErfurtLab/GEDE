# Blockchain Technology
This folder contains all information that has been collected within the realm of the GEDE topic group as relevant for the discussion of blockchain technology (BCT) with a particular focus on possible application scenarios in the research domain. 

The folder also contains the final paper summarising the usefulness of BCT from a research perspective which may be controversial since blockchain technology is still in development. The final document is called: "Blockchain Technology and FAIR Digital Objects - what is needed in science?"

Currently, we collected the following information which we believe is neutral and factual and not written by someone who wants to sell this technology.
- the Case Statement of the RDA WG on BCT in Health
- a paper from P. Lyons & R. Kahn about the framework in which BC and other technologies evolved over time
- two slide sets from V. Valivaari who is analysing the BCT for applying it in Finnish society
- a report written by NIST which we can recommend reading to understand BCT
- a summary of statements on BCT found in some documents incl. ERCIM contributions collected by W. Kuchinke & P. Wittenburg
- a link to an ERCIM special report on BCT which we can also recommend: https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en110/special/introduction-to-the-special-theme-blockchain-engineering
- a first elaboration on BCT in the medical area from Kuchinke & Wittenburg
- a slide set from P. Nikander who analysed the requirements to run a full node
