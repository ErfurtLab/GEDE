This folder contains all information that has been collected as relevant for the discussion of blockchain technology (BCT) with a particular focus on possible application scenarios in the research domain. 
The intention is to soon publish here a paper summarising the usefulness of BCT from a resarch perspective that will further be discussed in the RDA GEDE community and beyond. Its content might be controversial.

Currently, we collected the following information which we believe is neutral and factual and not written by someone who wants to sell this technology.
- a report written by NIST which we can recommend reading to understand BCT
- a link to an ERCIM special report on BCT which we can also recommend: https://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en110/special/introduction-to-the-special-theme-blockchain-engineering
- a first elaboration on BCT in the medical area from Kuchinke & Wittenburg
- a slide set from P. Nikander who analysed the requirements to run a full node
- a slide set from V. Valivaari who is analysing the BCT for applying it in Finnish society
- a paper from P. Lyons & R. Kahn about the framework in which BC and other technologies evolved over time
