RDA GEDE organised a workshop final to its funding period under the contract with the RDA EU 4 project. It was 
meant to kick-off a phase of brainstorming about possible future directions of RDA GEDE given recent developments. RDA GEDE 
started in 2016 to intensify the interaction with the research communities mainly in Europe. In the meantime many developments 
took place asking for aligning the goals. RDA worked in small groups on a few topics such as PIDs, Blockchain Technology, Citation, 
Repository Role and organised surveys on various issues. The work on (FAIR) Digital Objects brought together many experts including 
those from other regions (US, CN, SA, CA, etc.). We merged the activities with C2CAMP and therefore GEDE is international. In the 
meantime also the EOSC process has proceeded at governance level and working groups are working on first papers guiding the EOSC work. 
Cluster projects have been initiated in Europe in a few domains to foster cross-silo work and some projects were started to
support the EOSC process. Therefore, we see some overlap in the activities.
Finally, EOSC as well as other comparable infrastructure initiatives needs to ensure that European researchers will have the best 
facilities at hand to be able to do competitive research. This was the reason for GEDE to start with contributions from three
distinguished data scientists and a computer scientist to set the scene. 

All slides are available here and we are working on a report which will summarise the essentials inviting everyone interested to 
participate in the discussion about future directions of RDA GEDE.
