This page is devoted to inform about the FAIR Digital Object Framework which is currently being discussed and which is meant to guide the possible implementations using different technologies.

The FDOF work will be temporarely guided by the Coordination Group which needs to work out a governance structure. A Technical Implementation Group will be in charge to work out more technical specifications in close collaborations with appropriate RDA groups that will discuss specifications in broad contexts. In this folder we will also include illustration and implementation examples.

The current version 1.02 of FDOF has been worked out by a collaboration between active experts involved in GEDE DO and GOFAIR, was discussed at two consensus meetings in Washington and Paris (both in October 2019) and commented on after the Paris meeting. They are now open for broad discussion and comments can be made here using the Github framework. A Google Doc version based on the actual version will be maintained to enable for commenting.

Th FDO Framework will be maintained by the FDO Coordination and Technical Implementation Groups.
