This page is devoted to inform about the FAIR Digital Object Framework which is currently being discussed and which is meant to guide the possible implementations using different technologies.

The FDOF will be temporarely guided by the Coordination Group which needs to work out a governance structure. A Technical Implementation Group will be in charge to work out more technical specifications in close collaborations with appropriate RDA groups that will discuss specifications in broad contexts. 

The first FDOF has been worked out by a collaboration between active experts involved in GEDE DO and GOFAIR and was presented at two consensus meetings in Washington and Paris (both in October 2019). The version 1.01 was created based on the comments during the Paris meeting. They are now open for broad discussion and comments can be made here using the Github framework. In short we will also create a Google Doc version for commenting.

Th FDOF Framework will be maintained by the FDOF Coordination and Technical Implementation Groups.
