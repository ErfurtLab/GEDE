This a folder where materials about EOSC discussed within or in the realm of the GEDE group will be circulated. Currently it covers 
the notes about a webinar about EOSC organised by GEDE and a discussion paper from Wittenburg & Strawn about different regional/national 
approaches to come to an eco system of data infrastructures which is a fairly complex enterprise.
