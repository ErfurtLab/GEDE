This a folder where materials about EOSC discussed within or in the realm of the GEDE group will be circulated. Currently it covers 
the notes about a virtual meeting about the relationship between EOSC and RDA GEDE and a discussion paper from Wittenburg & Strawn 
about different regional/national approaches to come to an eco system of data infrastructures which is a fairly complex enterprise. 
The result of the virtual meeting was that GEDE decided to get involved where possible since GEDE has established a trustful 
collaboration with many RI in Europe. We will contribute with surveys, concrete small projects and will seek funding support from the
Co-Creation funds of the EOSC Sec Project. A core group has been defined to further discuss these aspects. A termporary document about 
engagement is being discussed.
