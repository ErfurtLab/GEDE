This survey is run by RDA GEDE, GOFAIR and ENVRI-FAIR to assess the set of technologies being used in the various research institutes, departments and projects. We expect substantial contributions from this survey to the work in RDA, GOFAIR, the ESFRI/ERICs projects, CODATA, etc. and it will help shaping the EOSC, etc. We also expect a continuous stream of input from an increasing number of participants and by participants updating their answers. We will regularly  generate snapshots of the database, analysing them by automatic means and published the summary results. 
Who should fill in this survey? We assume that the persons participating in this survey are responsible for managing and curating a sizable collection of data in your organisation or initiative. In general, the participant should be member of a team responsible for running a repository, be it a small or big one.

This survey is being done in 3 phases: 1) The first phase started in January with many tests of questions with experts from GOFAIR implementation networks, ENVRI-FAIR members and first testers from ESFRIs/ERICs. 2) The second phase started recently with a consolidated set of questions embedded in an easy to use wizard. It is directed to the ESFRIs/ERICs collaborating in RDA GEDE to with the hope to have one or two experts from these initiatives to check all aspects and fill in the questionnaire. This phase will be used to make a first analysis, to see whether the questions need to be adapted and to prepare the side meeting at the RDA Plenary in Helsinki. 3) We will invite everyone interested to join the Helsinki side meeting to finalise the questionnaire and then launch it broadly, so that everyone interested can participate.

We got now into contact with a few projects funded under the EOSC regime (FAIRsFAIR, EOSC Sec, etc.) which are also intending to run 
surveys. There seems to be the wish to run quite a number of such surveys with different foci and it is agreed that a synchronisation and
co-branding should occur at the Helsinki meeting.

In case of questions, please, don't hesitate to contact Peter Wittenburg (Skype: peterwittenburg1). 

If you are interested to participate in phase 2, you should have expert knowledge and be member of an ESFRI/ERIC associated with RDA GEDE.
Please, check with Peter to get the access code, since in this phase we still are testing. The uploaded quick guide may give an impression 
about the current state of the survey.
