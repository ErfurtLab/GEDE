A survey has been run on the views of members of RI participating in RDA GEDE. However, due to an error the results were difficult to 
interpret. We therefore carried out interviews with 22 RI members and wrote a summary note about views, expectation and wishes. On purpose we did not ask for official statements from RIs, since these would be politically influenced.
