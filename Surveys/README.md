# Surveys
This folder contains material about past and ongoing surveys being carried out by RDA GEDE. 
- Recently a joint survey was made about the knowledge about EOSC and FAIR within GEDE. Due to an error the evaluation takes slightly longer.
- Currently we are preparing a joint survey on methods and technologies being used by the various research infrastructures in close collaboration with GOFAIR and the ENVRI-FAIR cluster project. This survey called Technology Matrix will be launched soon.
